"In many branches of science and engineering a common equation, relating two physical quantities, we might encounter is of the form: y=Axn where A is a constant. If one would like to confirm a power law and figure out what A and n are, one way to do that is to plot a log-log graph of y and x. If one takes the logarithm of both sides, one obtains: log(y)=log(Axn) and since we know that log(ab)=log(a)+log(b) and log(cd)=dlog(c)​ we get: log(y)=log(A)+nlog(x)
And if we plot log(y) vs. log(x) the data should lie on a straight line. If we do the best fit line, the slope of the line should gives n, and the log(y) intercept should be log(A). The following questions in this assignment will be based on the information given above. For the graph below, determine the power of x(n=?). Express your answer using two decimal places.

"In many branches of science and engineering a common equation, relating two physical quantities, we might encounter is of the form: y=Axn where A is a constant. If one would like to confirm a power law and figure out what A and n are, one way to do that is to plot a log-log graph of y and x. If one takes the logarithm of both sides, one obtains: log(y)=log(Axn) and since we know that log(ab)=log(a)+log(b) and log(cd)=dlog(c)​ we get: log(y)=log(A)+nlog(x)

"A ball rolls without slipping or sliding on a surface. The mass of the ball is given as m and the radius of the ball is given as r. The ball is made of a thinwalled metallic shell with a hollow core. The rotational inertia of the hollow ball about the central point is given as I=32​mr2. Suppose the ball approaches a gently rolling hill as shown. Assume over the top, the hill is shaped in a circular arc with a given radius of curvature R. Assume that when the ball is at the top of the hill, it is a given height h above the level ground as shown. Assume that air resistance can be neglected.

"Lab Question 6: While riding with my grandson a few weeks ago on the Space Mountain ride at Disney World, I encountered some forces that I arguably should no longer voluntarily subject myself too. One interaction was a result of a sharp right turn during the ride. As we entered in the turn, I was thrown against the left side of the car and my left side of my torso certainly felt it. There was a force that resulted from being thrown into the side of the car. There also was a force that acted on the car so that I would feel that second force. One of them is centripetal force and the other is centrifugal force. Look at the Latin roots of the terms and explain the differences. Also, I categorically deny any suggestions by my grandson, Jerrod that I was screaming “I want my mommy!” during the ride. Give your own example of this kind of interaction.",http://api.scraperapi.com/?api_key=848b01434fc3b4899dc4ca9628acbb85&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chegg.com%2Fhomework-help%2Fquestions-and-answers%2Flab-question-6-riding-grandson-weeks-ago-space-mountain-ride-disney-world-encountered-forc-q107106128
