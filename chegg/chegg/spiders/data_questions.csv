"Transformers are devices used to increase or decrease AC voltages with very little waste of energy. Step-up transformers allow a device such as a television tube, which may need 25,000 V, to get the voltage it needs from a wall outlet that usually supplies only 120 V. Likewise, a step-down transformer can allow a small device, such as a battery charger, to be supplied from the same outlet with as little as 1.5 V. Imagine that you had to construct a transformer capable of running a television set that was going to be plugged into a conventional 120 V outlet that was on a 15 A line. On the primary coil of your transformer are 200 turns. 1. How many turns will you need on your secondary coil if the television needs 25,000 V to function? 2. What is the induced current in the secondary circuit?

One interaction was a result of a sharp right turn during the ride. As we entered in the turn, I was thrown against the left side of the car and my left side of my torso certainly felt it. There was a force that resulted from being thrown into the side of the car. There also was a force that acted on the car so that I would feel that second force. One of them is centripetal force and the other is centrifugal force. Look at the Latin roots of the terms and explain the differences. Also, I categorically deny any suggestions by my grandson, Jerrod that I was screaming “I want my mommy!” during the ride.
